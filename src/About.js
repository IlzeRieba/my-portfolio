        <p>
          I’m a certified trauma-informed counsellor, offering a warm and
          supportive space. I work in a way that’s guided by you, with deep
          respect for your experiences and your pace. My own life has shaped how
          I show up. I try to create a space that feels calm, open, and
          accepting — a space where you can be yourself. I believe healing
          happens in safe connection, and that the relationship we build
          together matters most.
